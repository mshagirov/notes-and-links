# Notes and links
> A place to keep links to papers, posts and other useful resources. Possibly I can add reading notes (not yet decided on how to format them).
- [Courses, tutorials, books, and other useful resources](List-of-courses.md)
- [Lists of papers](things_to_read.MD) (with repos and blog posts where available)
- [Notes on how to read papers](/on_reading_papers/howtoreadapaper.pdf) (`pdf`,`tex`)
- [Reading notes](/notes/reading_notes.md)
- [Compute, colab etc.](compute-notes.md)
