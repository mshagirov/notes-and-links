### Thinking, Fast and Slow
- Answer(/question) substitution: a common cognitive bias(/error) that arises when individual faces an unknown/difficult task, or sets it as an ill-defined question.
    * Will this politician win the election? <--> does he look like the winner?
    * Will I finish this project in 2 months? <--> did I do well yesterday, or worse, am I feeling happy right now?
- Premortemâ€” a technique for overcoming overconfident optimism (proposed by Gary Klein), when you/or your organisation/ has almost come to an important decision (but not committed to doing it yet):
    * gather a group of people that are familiar with the decision
    * "Imagine that we are a year into the future. We implemented the plan as it now exists. The outcome was a disaster. Please take 5 to 10 minutes to write a brief history of that disaster."
    * this helps to overcome the "groupthink" and to avoid suppression of public doubt
    * as a team converges on a decision (especially, after the leader is almost decided), generally, any doubt that is expressed publicly is considered as disloyalty to the team.
    * allows even supporters of the decision to search for potential threats,
    * the premortem legitimises doubts.
